Simple implementation of android's cover flow widget. It is largely based on excellent  code from Neil
http://www.inter-fuser.com/2010/02/android-coverflow-widget-v2.html

Example activity which is embedded into the library is shown below:

Main changes were about performance improvements, layering adapters (including Image reflection layer), packaging as library project + custom attributes, so that cover flow can be configured in XML.

Example of usage is here:
